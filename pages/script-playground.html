                    <p>Store your data with data types</p>
                    <p>Types help define variables - here are some examples of PRIMITIVE TYP:</p>
                    <ul class="code-text">
                        <li>Number</li>

                    <br> can add or append additional text, extract bits of text, or remove letters.</p>
                    <p>These are <strong>Primitive types </strong> and are the basic building blocks of every data structure in JavaScript.</p>

                    <p>While you do not need to declare a variable's type in JavaScript (more on this a little later),
                        it is important to understand their existence and importance.</p>

                    console.log(typeof largeDecimal) <br>
                    </p>

                    <p> When the console logs are run above they return "number" which shows the type is seen as a
                        number
                    </p>
                    <p>Variables of type number can be either positive or negative. They can also be whole numbers (1,
                        2, 3, etc) or decimals (1.4, 67.34, etc).
                    </p>

                            Where possible, use integer calculations instead (when calculating prices, for example, think in
                            cents, not euros or dollars).

                        They are used in all sorts of cases: whether or not a user is signed in, a checkbox is checked,
                        or a specific set of conditions are met. </p>

                        Anything from one letter to quite a large number of letters (over 134 million even in older
                        browsers)
                        can be stored in a variable of type strings:

                        Strings can also be concatenated (one added to the end of another) using the + operator:<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong> <p class="code-text"> <span class="vari">wholeName</span> = <span class="vari">firstName </span> + ' ' + <span class="vari">lastName; </span> <span class="console"> // value: "Will Alexander" </span></strong></p>
                        <br>
                        Other more sophisticated operators exist for strings, and we will explore them in later
                        chapters.</p>

                    <h4>Types in JavaScript</h4>
                    <p>JavaScript is what is called a dynamic, or loosely-typed language. <br>
                        This means that you can initialize a variable as a number, then reassign it as a string, <br>
                        or any other type of variable. This allows for a lot of flexibility, but it can <br>
                        also lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful: </p>

                    <p>Let's recap!
                        In this chapter, you learned the three main primitive data types in JavaScript.<br>

                        number<br>

                        boolean<br>

                        string<br>

                        Other, more complex data types exist, and in the next chapter,<br>
                        <br>
                        we will start looking at a very useful one: objects. <br>

                        Technically, there are three other primitive data types in JavaScript: null, <br>

                        <h4 class="title-central">What are objects?</h4>
                        <p>You've probably heard the term <strong>object</strong> in a programming context before. <br>
                            But what does it really mean? Let's start by looking at some real-world objects, <br>
                            like pens, books, smartphones, computers, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p> You recognize all pens — fountain, ballpoint, felt-tip, gel, and so on — as being part of
                            <br>
                            a type of object: pens.<br>
                            <br>
                            You can write with them, they use ink, and they can be held in one hand.<br>
                            <br>
                            The same goes for books: they have a cover, a number of pages, a title, and one or more
                            authors.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You notice commonalities between different objects, collect the information, and create a
                            mental <br>
                            representation for a category of objects.

                        </p>

                        <p>This mental list of attributes acts as a blueprint for that object. In programming, it's
                            called a <strong>class</strong>. <br>
                            When creating a class, you can come up with any custom name, which is why they are called a
                            named type. <br>
                            <br>
                            As you'll see, they also allow you to group lots of details together, which is why they can
                            be referred <br>
                            to as <strong>complex types</strong>.</p>

                        <p> we could use the <strong>let </strong> keyword or <strong>const </strong> as we aren't going to change these variables

                            You will often need many objects of the same type: <br>
                            <br>
                            This is where <strong>classes </strong> come in handy. <br>
                        </p>

                        <p>A class is a blueprint for an object in code. <br>
                            It allows you to build multiple objects of the same type (called

    <h2>Arrays</h2>

    <div class="script-container">
        <div class="script-wrapper">
            <h4 class="title-central"> Manage complexity with the right collection</h4>
            <div class="script__description">
                <p>There are many situations where you will have multiple objects or variables which you want to treat as a group or list.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users connected to your show</li>
                    <li>Users connected to your app</li>
                    <li>Names of local restaurants</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In javascript the most common form of collection is the <strong>Array.</strong></p>
                <p>An <strong>array</strong> is an ordered list.</p>
                <p>This means that each element in the array has an index which corresponds to it's position in the list:</p>
                <p>Similar to the number on each house on a street:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first element has an index of <strong>0</strong></li>  
                    <li>The second an index of <strong>1</strong></li>
                    <li>The third an index of <strong>2</strong> and so on...</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Arrays are extremely useful.</strong></p>
                <p>There are two other forms of collection in javascript <strong>Sets</strong> and <strong>Maps.</strong><br>
                These collections have their use cases but are far less common...</p>
            </div>

            <div class="script__description key-info">
                <h4>Using an array to store an ordered list of elements:</h4>
                <p>Storing information about guests that get front row seats:</p>
                <p class="code-text">
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari">guests</span> = [<span class="strng">"Sarah Kate"</span>, <span class="strng"> "Aubrey Simon"</span>, <span class="strng">"Will Alexander"</span>];
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First declare the array with "let" and the array name (looks like you use lowercase for it) </li>
                    <li>As opposed to an object that uses curly brackets - <strong> an array uses square brackets</strong></li>
                    <li>Then we add the guest names in between the square brackets - in between quotation marks"" and separated with commas</li>
                    <li>The above displays an array of 3 strings.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>What happens when we console log this?</h4>

                <p class="code-text">console.log(guests);</p>
                <p>Returns the below:</p>
                <p class="code-text console">["Sarah Kate",  "Aubrey Simon", "Will Alexander"]</p>

            </div>
            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>What happens if you want to get a specific member of the array?</h4>
                <p>The whole point here is it is an ordered list...</p>
                <p>Unless we change the order - the elements of that list will keep their order.</p>
                <h4>How would we get the first element of the array?</h4>
                <p class="code-text">console.log(guests[0]);</p>
                <p>Above we have added square brackets after the variable name, followed by the index we want to get, remember
                   the <strong> first item in the array is indexed as 0.</strong></p>
                <p>The above returns the first element in the array</p>
                <p class="code-text console">"Sarah Kate"</p>
                <p>What happens when you are trying to get something that is outside of the array (ie you give it a number that isn't on the index):</p>
                <p class="code-text console">undefined</p>
            </div>

            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>Adding Variables to Arrays:</h4>
                <p>Instead of just creating an array and passing values in - you can pass in variables </p>
                <p class="code-text"> 
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari">firstGuest </span> = <span class="strng">'Sarah Kate';</span> <br> 
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari">secondGuest </span></secondGuest>= <span class="strng">'Will Alexander';</span> <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari">guests </span> = <span class="vari">[firstGuest, secondGuest]</span>;
                </p>

                <p>Now if we console log our guests array to the console:</p>

                <p class="code-text">
                    console.log(guests);
                </p>
                 <p>We get the values that was associated with those variables</p>

                <p class="code-text console">
                 ["Sara Kate, Will Alexander"]
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>Adding Objects to Arrays</h4>
                <p>Instead of having a string we can add an object</p>
                <p class="code-text"> 
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari">firstGuest</span> = <span class="obj">{name: <span class="strng">'Sarah Kate'</span>, vip: <span class="bool">true </span> }</span>; <br> 
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari">secondGuest </span> =<span class="obj"> {name:<span class="strng">'Will Alexander'</span>, vip: <span class="bool">false}</span>; <br></span>
                    <br>
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari"> guests </span> = <span class="vari">[firstGuest, secondGuest]</span>;
                </p>

                <p>If we run console log again:</p>
                <p class="code-text">
                    console.log(guests);
                </p>

                <p>We get:</p>

                <p class="code-text console">
                    [[object Object]{ <br>
                        name: "Sarah Kate" <br>
                        vip: true <br>
                    }, [object Object]{ <br>
                        name: "Will Alexander" <br>
                        vip: false <br>
                    }]
                    
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>Step by Step</h4>
                <p>To create an empty array and store it in a variable, you use a pair of square brackets:</p>
                <p class="code-text"> <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari">guests</span> = []</p>
                <p>You can also create a populated array by putting the desired elements inside those square brackets: </p>
                <p class="code-text"> <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari">guests</span> = [<span class="strng">'Sarah Kate'</span>,<span class="strng">'Audrey Simon'</span>,<span class="strng">'Will Alexander'</span> ];</p>
                <p>You can then access elements of that array by their index:</p>
                <p class="code-text"><span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari">firstGuest</span> = guests[0]; <span class="console">// 'Sarah Kate'</span><br>
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari"></span>thirdGuest = guests[2]; <span class="console">// 'Will Alexander'</span> <br>
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> undefinedGuest = guests[12] <span class="console">// undefined </span> <br>
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>In Javascript, primitive types like numbers, booleans, and strings are passed by <strong>value</strong>. <br>

                <p>It is the <strong>value</strong> 20, which is copied into the new variable, and no link is maintained between the two variables.</p>

                    This is not the case with objects and arrays, which are passed by <strong> reference.</strong> <br>
                    If you are not aware of this, it can lead to some unexpected behaviors. <br>
                    For example:
                </p>
                <p class="code-text">

                <p>Even though we created the array and passed it the object before modifying the object,

                    <br>
                    This is because when using arrays and objects, 
                    you are passing <strong>references</strong> to the objects, as opposed to the value of the data within them. <br>

                <p>3 useful tools when working with arrays</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Length:</strong> <br> A property that every Array has. </li>
                    <li><strong>The Push Method:</strong> <br>Allows you to add a new element to the array</li>
                    <li><strong>The Pop Method</strong> <br>Deletes the final element of the array</li>
                </ul>
                <p>First create an array:</p>
                <p class="code-text">
                    let guests = ['Will Alexander', 'Sarah Kate', 'Audrey Simon'];

                <h4>Counting Elements</h4>
                <p>The length property of an array tells you how many elements there are in it:</p>

                    let guests = ['Will Alexander', 'Sarah Kate', 'Audrey Simon']; <br>

                <p>Use dot notation to access the length property of your array. 
                    This may not be very useful in this example (seeing as we know how many guests we put in the array!), 
                    but there are many situations in which you will not know how many elements an array has in advance.

    <h2>Sets and Maps</h2>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="script__description">
            <p>Now that you've started to get a grip on arrays let's take a look at the other kinds of
                JavaScript collection: <strong>sets </strong>and <strong>maps</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="script__description">
            <h4>Sets</h4>
            <p>In JavaScript, a <strong>set</strong> is an <strong>unordered list</strong>.</p>
            <p>This means that you cannot reliably retrieve specific list elements, as they do not have a fixed index. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Instead, you can add and remove elements (duplicates are not allowed), and check whether a set contains
                a certain element or not.  <br>
                <br>
                Sets can come in handy for things like storing which users are online at a 
                given time so you can check if they are or not.</p>

        </div>


        <div class="script__description">
            <h4>Maps</h4>
            <p>On the other hand, a <strong> map </strong>is an <strong> ordered list of key/value pairs</strong>.</p>
            <p>While this sounds like an object, there are some important differences. <br>
            <br>
            For example, <strong> keys can be any value (not just strings) in maps </strong>; you can easily find its  size, and its key/value pairs can be filtered or modified in certain circumstances.</p>
            
        </div>

        <div class="script__description">
            <p>Sets and maps, while useful in certain situations, are beyond the scope of this course.

                <p>This function - is in fact the program</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Synonymous with the program.</li>
                    <li>It is triggered first - (It is the starting point)<br>
                        and the program executes based on whatever logic is within the main program.</li>

                <h2>JSBin</h2>
                <p>JSBin is a great tool for trying out snippets of JavaScript: 
                    that's why I've been using it to demonstrate certain tools or principles. 
                    Let's explore how it runs code - VIDEO
                </p>

                <p>In JSBin, you can write code line for line in the JavaScript pane, and hit the Run button to execute. 
                    JSBin then runs through your lines of code and executes them one after the other. 
                    Therefore, order is important:
                </p>

                <p class="key-info">When you hit run in JSBin: Whilst there is no explicit main function in JSBin - run is the main fucntion.
                    When run is hit: the code runs from top to bottom - this is important - see how 
                    switching the order of things effects output in the example below:
                </p>

                <p class="code-text">let numberOfGuests = 20; <br>
                    console.log(numberOfGuests); // 20
                </p>

                <p>Is not the same as
                    <p class="code-text"> 
                        console.log(numberOfGuests); // undefined <br>
                        let numberOfGuests = 20;
                    </p>
                    

                </p>

            <div class="script__description">
                <h2>Web Pages</h2>
                <p>If you have been following along with the exercises so far, you have been writing 
                    JavaScript code for a web page. However, you have not yet seen how your code is 
                    interpreted behind the scenes!
                </p>

                <p>In the Codevolve exercises in previous chapters, you were invited to add some code to 
                    a JavaScript file. But how was that code then executed in the built-in browser?</p>

                <p>Well, there were some other files (to which you did not have access) which did that work for you. 
                    Firstly, there was another JavaScript file which imported your episodes array and generated elements
                     it then added to the web page. That file was then imported by the HTML file (that tells the browser 
                     what should be on the page), and automatically ran the code.</p>

                <p>This is pretty much how JavaScript works on the web. You write some code, save it in one or more
                     files, and then import those files using a special tag in your HTML file. The browser then automatically 
                     runs the code in those files, generally speaking in the order in which they are imported.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="script__description">
                <h2>Servers</h2>
                <p>It used to be that JavaScript could only be used in web pages (on the front end), but not any more!
                     It can now also be used on the back end, managing access to certain resources.
                    </p>
                <p>For example, take any webmail service. You have a web page through which you can access your emails, 
                    but they are not stored in that page. They are stored in a database, and the page you use accesses that 
                    database through a server, which can be written in JavaScript!
                </p>
                <p>However, servers need to be running at all times, and only specific pieces of code need to run at certain times. 
                    For example, the code that allows you to access your emails should only be executed if and when you decide to open
                     your mail client!
                    </p>
                <p>In this case, an environment (like Node) coupled with specific JavaScript code, allows this to happen. 
                    The server reacts to you opening the mail client, verifies authentication, and sends your emails.

                <h4 class="key-info"> Program flow</h4>
                <p>Program flow is the sequence of instructions, the lines of code you have written</p>
                <p>They can be executed line by lin, one after another, or repeated a few times, or even skip in certain circumstances</p>
                <p>That is the flow</p>

            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>Controlling the flow</h4>
                <p>We use various techniques to control the flow of a program</p>
                <p>For Example</p>
                <p>If we are sorting out our shopping reciepts as we pick them up we check them:</p>
                <p>If it is for groceries, we put it in a grocery folder</p>
                <p>If it is a receipt we accidentally picked up at the counter - it belongs to someone else and we throw it away</p>
                <p>Here a <span class="key-info"><strong>Condition</strong></span> is dictating what happens next.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>If/Else statements</h4>
                <p>This is based on a condition</p>
                <p><span class="key-info">If</span> (condition A is met)</p>
                <p>A program will execute one block of code (block of code 1)</p>
                <p>(if not) <span class="key-info">Else </span>  execute another block of code (block of code 2)</p>
                <p>To validate the expression a <span class="key-info">Boolean</span> expression is used</p>
                <p>Booleans are the most primitive data type : having two values: true or false:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If (true)</li>
                    <li>Else (false)</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>If/Else statements continued...</h4>
                <p>The if/else statement is one of the most ubiquitous in programming. 
                    Whether reacting to user input, the results of calculations, 
                    or simply checking whether someone is logged in or not, you will often find yourself using if/else statements.</p>
                <p class="code-text">IF the user is logged in, take them to their home page <br>
                                    ELSE redirect them to the login page

                </p>

                <p>This is known as a conditional statement, because it checks if certain conditions are met, and reacts accordingly. 
                     Let's have a look at which kinds of conditions can be used in these statements.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>Another way to control the flow is switch</h4>
                <p>This is sort of like a sibling of the if/else statement</p>
                <p>Switch uses distinct cases to list possible conditions</p>
                <p>A switch must cover all possible conditions</p>
                <p>Any conditions that are not listed in the cases fall into the <span class="key-info">Default</span> class.</p>
                <p>This default class is a sibling of the final else block in the If/else statement</p>
            </div>

            <div class="script__description">
                <p>There is one more data type we need to know:</p>
                <h4>Enumerations</h4>
                <p>These are a set of possible cases</p>
                <p> A good example would be categories of products sold in a store</p>
                <p>enumeration : store categories <br>
                    { case 1 : furniture <br>
                      case 2 : Curtains <br>
                      case 3 : Home Decorations  <br>
                </p>
                <p>there could be a few in the begining then they could grow as the store expands into selling new products</p>
            </div>

        </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="script__description">
            <h4>Using Booleans</h4>
            <p>In JavaScript, when using simple booleans for if /else statements, the syntax looks like this:</p>

            <p class="code-text">if (myBoolean) { <br>
                // react to myBoolean being true<br>
            } else {<br>
                // react to myBoolean being false<br>
            }</p>

            <p>So to check if a user is logged in, you can do the following:</p>

            <p class="code-text">
                <span class="let-dec"> let</span> <span class="vari"> userLoggedIn </span> = <span class="bool"> true</span>; <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ifelse"> if</span> (userLoggedIn) {<br>
                console.log('<span class="console">User logged in!</span>');<br>
                } <span class="ifelse"> else </span> {<br>
                console.log('<span class="console">Intruder alert!</span>');<br>
                } <br>
            </p>

            <p>In the above case, you will get 'User logged in!' printed to the console, as the  userLoggedIn 
                 boolean is set to  true. If it were set to  false, you would get 'Intruder alert!' instead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="script__description">
            <h4>Using expressions</h4>
            <p>Instead of using a simple boolean variable as an  if /else  condition, 
                you can also use comparative expressions, where you compare values with each other: </p>
                <h4>Theatre guests example:</h4>
                <p class="code-text">const numberOfSeats = <span class="num"> 30</span>;<br>
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span> <span class="vari"> numberOfGuests</span> = <span class="num">25</span>;
                </p>

                <p>Here we have declared a constant numberOfSeats - as this number does not change</p>
                <p>Then we have declared the numberOfGuests = 25; (a variable)</p>

                <p class="code-text">const numberOfSeats = <span class="num"> 30</span>;<br>
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span><span class="vari"> numberOfGuests</span> = <span class="num">25</span>; <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="ifelse">if </span> (<span class="vari">numberOfGuests</span> < numberOfSeats) { <br>
                        console.log('<span class="console">Seats remaining!</span>'); <br>
                    } <span class="ifelse">else </span> { <br>
                        console.log('<span class="console">No seats left!</span>'); <br>
                    } <br>
                </p>

                <p> You can see the two conditions and their results are between curly brackets above.</p>  
            </div>
            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>if(), else if(), else() </h4>

                <p>You can also chain  <strong> if /else </strong> statements to react to multiple potential conditions:</p>

                <p class="code-text">const numberOfSeats = <span class="num"> 30</span>;<br>
                    <span class="let-dec">let</span><span class="vari"> numberOfGuests</span> = <span class="num">25</span>; <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="ifelse">if </span> (numberOfSeats == <span class="vari">numberOfGuests</span>) { <br>
                        console.log('<span class="console">All seats used!</span>'); <br>
                    } <span class="ifelse">else if </span> (numberOfSeats < <span class="vari">numberOfGuests</span>){ <br>
                        console.log('<span class="console">Too many Guests!</span>'); <br>
                    } <span class="ifelse">else  </span>{<br>
                     console.log('<span class="console">Seats remaining!</span>'); <br>
                    }
                </p>

                <p>Here we check if the number of seats is equal to the number of guests</p>
                <p>If that is true then the console returns: All seats are used!</p>
                <p>If there are fewer seats than there are guests, then we have too many guests and 
                    console log returns that message.
                </p>
                <p>Finally if there are more seats then guests the final message is returned saying that there are seats remaining</p>

            </p>

            <p>Will javascript see the above as equal?</p>
            <p>We have one data type as a number, and the other as a string value?</p>
            <p class="code-text console">They are equal</p>
            <p>The answer is yes, javascript allows the two to be equal</p>
            <p>However if we are to use === it means will compare value and type</p>

            <h4>IMPORTANT - Variable Scoping</h4>
            <p>In JavaScript, variables created with  <strong>let</strong> or <strong>const</strong> can only 
                be seen or used inside the code block where they are declared.</p>
            <p><strong>Variable have certain scopes in certain parts of code</strong></p>
            <p>Our if else code is the first time we have seen code with different scopes</p>
            <p>You will undoubtedly come across the legacy  var  keyword for creating variables during your development career.
                Variables declared this way are not block-scoped but function-scoped, so they do not behave in exactly 
                the same way as the variables and constants I describe in this course. For more information, 
                check out <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-var-and-let-in-javascript/"> this article</a>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="script__description key-info">
            <h4>Block Scoping</h4>
            <p>A code block, often shortened to block, is a section of code enclosed in curly braces  {}.</p>
            <p>This phenomenon is known as <strong>block scoping</strong>.  Here is an example:</p>
            <p class="code-text">
                let userLoggedIn = true; <br>
                 <br>
                if (userLoggedIn) {  <br>
                let welcomeMessage = 'Welcome back!';  <br>
                } else {  <br>
                let welcomeMessage = 'Welcome new user!';  <br>
                }  <br>
                 <br>
                console.log(welcomeMessage); <span class="console"> // throws an error </span>  <br>
            </p>
            <p>In this code, you have two code blocks as a result of the if / else  statement. 
                They are highlighted in the image below:
            </p>
            <img src="../images/JS Images/Conditional Statements/Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 11.25.46.png" alt="">
            <p>In both the orange and pink highlighted blocks, declare a variable with  let welcomeMessage. 
                However, these variables are only available inside the blocks where they are declared. 
                This is why, when you try to log the contents of welcomeMessage to the console, you get an error: 
                as far as the code outside the blocks (also known as the outer or parent scope) is concerned, 
                there is no  welcomeMessage variable!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="script__description key-info">
            <p>So, how would we achieve the desired behavior? How do we pass values out from inside a code block?</p>
            <p>In this case, one method would be to declare the variable in the outer scope, and then modify it inside the  if /else  blocks:

            </p>
            <p class="code-text"> let userLoggedIn = true; <br>
            let welcomeMessage = ''; // declare the variable here <br>
            <br>
            if (userLoggedIn) { <br>
                welcomeMessage = 'Welcome back!'; // modify the outer variable <br>
            } else { <br>
                welcomeMessage = 'Welcome new user!'; // modify the outer variable <br>
            } <br>
            <br>
            console.log(welcomeMessage); // prints 'Welcome back!' <br>
            <br>    
            </p>
            <p>Here, because the variable is declared in the parent scope, it is available everywhere, and can be accessed and modified properly.</p>
            <p>Parents declared in the outer scope (the two let statements above the else) are available to those in the inner scope (the welcomeMessage 's'  that are within the if else blocks)</p>
            <p>look at how we removed the "let" for inside the if else statements</p>
            <p>For the default welcome message (parent scope) we also added:
                <ul>
                    <li> ' ';  </li>
                    <li> We could have also used: default;</li>
                    <li> or just left it blank after a semicolon: ;</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Remember to <strong>DECLARE </strong> outside the IF ELSE block and to <strong>MODIFY </strong> within it</p>

            <h4>Switch Statements</h4>
            <p>What if you want to check the value of a variable against a list of expected values, and react accordingly?   For that, you use the switch statement: 
            </p>
            <p>Let's say you have some user objects and want to check which kind of account each user has, and send a custom message:
            </p>

            <p class="code-text"> 
                let firstUser = {           <br>
                    name: 'Will Alexander', <br>
                    age: 33,                <br>
                    accountLevel: 'normal'  <br>
                };    <br>
                <br>
                let secondUser = {          <br>
                    name: 'Sarah Kate',     <br>  
                    age: 21,    <br>
                    accountLevel: 'premium' <br>
                }; <br>
                <br>
                let thirdUser = {   <br>
                    name: 'Audrey Simon',  <br>
                    age: 27,   <br>
                    accountLevel: 'mega-premium'  <br>
                };  <br>

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="script__description">

            <p>Here, you can use a  switch  statement, which takes the variable you wish to check, and a list of the values to check for as cases: 
            </p>

            <p class="code-text">
                <span class="switch"> switch</span> (firstUser.accountLevel) {  <br>
                    <span class="switch">case</span>'normal':  <br>
                        console.log('<span class="console">You have a normal account!</span>');  <br>
                        <span class="switch">break</span>;  <br>
                        <span class="switch">case</span>'premium':  <br>
                        console.log('<span class="console">You have a premium account!</span>');  <br>
                        <span class="switch">break</span>;  <br>
                        <span class="switch">case</span> 'mega-premium':  <br>
                        console.log('<span class="console">You have a mega premium account!</span>');  <br>
                        <span class="switch">break</span>;  <br>
                        <span class="switch">default: </span> <br>
                        console.log('<span class="console">Unknown account type!</span>');  <br>
                } <br>
            </p>

            <p>After the code to execute in each <strong>case</strong>, add the break statement. <span class="key-info">If you do not do this, JavaScript will keep executing the following cases (known as <strong>cascading</strong>) until it meets a break statement or the end of the switch </span>. As you can see in the example, you can also add a  default case which will only be executed if the variable you are checking does not match any of the listed values.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="script__description key-info">
            <p> As you can see,  switch statements also use curly braces. This is another example of a code block, so any variables declared inside a  switch  statement will not be available to the surrounding code!

                        console.log('<span class="console">Passenger boarded!</span>'); <br>
                    } <br>
                </p>
                <p>For this type of  for loop, create an <strong> index variable i </strong> which serves as a counter for the number of times it has been executed — this is why it starts at 0, as you have not been through the loop yet. <br> 
                <br>
                <span class="key-info"> Every time we go through the loop the counter goes up</span></p>
                <p>The second command in the  for parentheses is the condition for continuing the loop: as soon as it evaluates to  false, you end the loop. In this case, you want it to execute as many times as there are passengers, so once index  i hits 10 (looped 10 times), you want to stop, as there are no passengers left.  </p>
                <p>The third command tells the for loop to increment  i  (add 1) every time it is run. This is what allows you to keep track of the number of loop executions.</p>

            <div class="script__description">
                <p>JavaScript will finish the loop before running any other code, so if you were to write this:</p>
                <p class="code-text">
                    const </span> <span class="vari"> numberOfPassengers</span> = <span class="num">10</span>; <br>
                    <br>
                        <span class="for"> for (let i = 0; i < numberOfPassengers; i++) </span> { <br>
                            console.log('<span class="console">Passenger boarded!</span>'); <br>
                        } <br>
                    <br>
                    console.log('<span class="console">All passengers boarded!</span>');<br>
                </p>
                <p class="key-info">The final console log would print after the 10 passengers are boarded. </p>
                <p> Working with indices (the plural of index) is all very well, but what if you are working with an array of passengers and need to board them in order?</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">

            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>Dealing with arrays:  for…of  and  for…in</h4>
                <p>There are many situations in which you will have an array and will need to work your way through it, doing something with each element. This could be updating prices on a menu, processing data from a database, or boarding passengers in order.</p>
                <p>The old-fashioned way of looping through an array was to use the  for loop you saw above, along with its  length  property. For example, with an array called  passengers:</p>

                <p class="code-text">
                <span class="for">for (let i = 0; i < passengers.length; i++) </span> {
                    console.log('<span class="console">Passenger boarded!</span>');
                }
            </p>

            <p>While this works, there are two easier ways of looping through (or iterating over) arrays.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>The for...in loop</h4>
                <p>The for…in loop works in a similar way to the above normal for loop example, but is easier to read, and does all the iteration work for you:</p>
                <p class="code-text">
                   <span class="constant-dec">const</span> <span class="vari">passengers</span> = [ <br>
                    '<span class="strng">Will Alexander</span>',  <br>
                    '<span class="strng">Sarah Kate</span>',  <br>
                    '<span class="strng">Audrey Simon</span>',  <br>
                    '<span class="strng">Tau Perkington</span>' <br>
                    ]  <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="for"> for (let i in <span class="vari">passengers</span>) </span> {  <br>
                    console.log('<span class="console">Boarding passenger</span>' + <span class="vari">passengers</span>[i]);  <br>
                    }
                </p>
                <p>As in the previous example,  i starts at zero automatically, and increments with each loop. So you log passengers[0], then passengers[1], then passengers[2], etc. until all passengers have been iterated over. You can of course print each element to the console, as each is a string containing the name of the passenger.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="script__description">
                <h4>The for…of loop</h4>
                <p>For cases where the specific index of an element is not needed during iteration, you can use a  for …of loop: </p>
