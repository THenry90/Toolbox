                    <br>The best pseudo-classes to use with transitions are those that the user will interact with as they browse the site.
                    
                    <br>You can chain pseudo-classes together to make more specific pseudo-selectors.
                    
                    <br>Pseudo-selectors can be used to manipulate its element's next sibling as well as itself.</p>

                <ul class="step-by-step-text email-form">
                    <li>Use the  :active  pseudo selector to provide the user with a bit of feedback, 
                        letting them know that they have made the input field active by highlighting it 
                        with a border</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>When we change the state of the input to :focus, it should add a purple border
                         to the element.</li>
                         <br>
                    <li>Combine it with the  :invalid  pseudo-class, so that they receive 
                        feedback that they haven't entered a valid email address.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Flickering between the :focus and  :invalid is a bit obnoxious. <br>
                        Make use of the :not() pseudo-selector, <br>
                        Combined with the  :focus pseudo-selector <br>
                        This allows the user to finish entering 
                        their email address before telling them whether it's valid or not:</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>&:focus {}</li>
                        <br>
                    <li> The :not() pseudo-selector registers as true when it's containing selector registers as false.<br>
                         In this case, :not() will return true if the input is not in the :focus state.<br> 
                         You can chain pseudo-classes together, just like with standard classes.<br>
                         <br> 
                         In this case, we've created a pseudo-selector that will apply its rule set if the element
                          isn't in the :focus state and the email address is :invalid.  This way we don't see the red warning 
                          signs of an invalid email until they've finished typing their address:</li>
                          <br>
                          <li>&:not(:focus):invalid {}</li>
                          <br>
                    <li>Add animation to the changes in state by adding a transition for the  background-color that takes
                         half of a second to complete:</li>
                         <br>
                    <li>"Transition:background-color:500ms;"</li>
                    <br>

                   Hover over me!
                </div>   
           </div>

           <p>When you want to transition multiple properties at once, 
            rather than typing the name of the property that you want to transition:</p>
            <p>transition: transform 450ms;</p>
            <p>Instead use the all keyword in its place:</p>
            <p>transition: all 450ms;</p>
            <p>By using the all keyword, you are telling the browser to transition
                all of the properties you have changed within the :hover pseudo-selector,
                rather than a specific property. So let's add a transition to the 
                .btn selector to animate both the scale of the button and its background opacity:</p>
            <p>Using the all keyword is perfect for when you want multiple things to happen at the same time,
                and for the same duration, but there's another way to add multiple properties to a transition.
                Rather than using all, you can list out the animations for each property that you'd like to 
                transition, separated by commas. So, in the case of our transitions for transform and 
                background-color, we could split them like this: </p>
            <p>transition: transform 450ms, background-color 450ms;</p>
            <p>Now that they're separate, you can give them different durations, which can help break up
                the uniformity of the animation, creating something more visually interesting to engage the user. 
                Let's make the background-color transition a little faster than the
                scale by shortening its duration to 300ms:</p>
                <p>transition: transform 450ms, background-color 300ms;</p>
                <p>Now the background-color will be fully opaque before the button has
                   finished scaling up. The difference isn't huge, but those few fractions 
                   of a second help make it feel a little less perfect and give it some texture:</p>
