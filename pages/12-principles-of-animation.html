                <h2>Squash and stretch</h2>
                <p class="explanation">This principle helps depict an object's mass and momentum, 
                    stretching the object's form as it accelerates, and then flattening and widening as it decelerates. 
                    Imagine a rubber ball bouncing on a hard floor, flattening out before springing away back up into the air.</p>

                    </div>
                <p class="explanation">Notice how the box stretches horizontally as it accelerates, and
                     squashes from the rapid deceleration as it hits the wall.

            <div class="topic-2-container">
                <h2>Anticipation</h2>
                <p class="explanation">Think of anticipation as a visual foreshadowing of an action to come. A cat coiling 
                    and wriggling before pouncing. Cocking an arm back before throwing a ball. Robots move from position to 
                    position. Creatures rely on preliminary motion to help gain leverage and power making movement without 
                    anticipation seem stale and artificial.</p>

            <div class="topic-2-container">
                <h2>Staging</h2>
                <p class="explanation">Staging, with respect to animation, can best be described as composition. It guides the
                     user's eyes to the most important parts of the screen through motion, such as highlighting a button you 
                     want them to click on:</p>

                        <img class="demo-gif" src="../images/staging.gif">
                    </div>
                    <div class="example-container">

            </div>

            <div class="topic-2-container">
                <h2>Straight ahead and pose-to-pose</h2>
                <p class="explanation">Straight ahead and pose-to-pose are two different ways of executing traditional, 
                    hand-drawn animation, and don't apply literally to animating for the web. However, within CSS, 
                    there are two methods for creating animations: the transitions you've begun to learn about, and 
                    keyframes, which we'll cover in a bit. Transitions are based on a starting and ending value that the 
                    browser animates between. But with keyframes, you'll learn how to add in stages, or poses:</p>

                        <img class="demo-gif" src="../images/straight ahead and pose-to-pose.gif">
                    </div>
                    <div class="example-container">
                        
                    </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic-2-container">
                <h2>Follow through and overlapping action</h2>
                <p class="explanation">Real objects don't have uniform density and mass, and thus will accelerate
                     and decelerate at different rates. Think of being in a car and having your head snapped back
                      into the headrest as it accelerates. Or having your head bounced forwards if the driver slammed
                       on the brakes. Without follow through or overlapping action, you would remain static within 
                       the car as it changed speed. By giving different parts of an object different velocities, 
                       animations feel more authentic:</p>

            <div class="topic-2-container">
                <h2>Slow in and slow out</h2>
                <p class="explanation">Also known as ease in and ease out, this principle is based on the fact 
                    that physical objects don't simply start and stop instantaneously. They accelerate and decelerate. 
                    Slow in refers to the acceleration of an object, and slow out refers to deceleration. Applying different
                     values to eases can change the perception of size or mass of an object. You can make things seem
                      zippier or more cumbersome depending on the profiles of the acceleration and deceleration:</p>

            <div class="topic-2-container">
                <h2>Arc</h2>
                <p class="explanation">It's said that nature doesn't make straight lines, and natural movements are no 
                    exception. This is a bit trickier with the web's box model, but introducing some arcs into the motion 
                    of objects can make them feel more natural:</p>

            <div class="topic-2-container">
                <h2>Secondary action</h2>
                <p class="explanation">Adding individual animations to separate pieces of a scene can help to accentuate 
                    or strengthen the primary elements of the animation:</p>

            <div class="topic-2-container">
                <h2>Timing</h2>
                <p class="explanation">Objects should move at believable rates in comparison to their sizes and mass. 
                    A semi-truck is going to accelerate and decelerate more slowly and evenly than a Ferrari, which can
                     get up to speed in the blink of an eye and stop on a dime. You control the timing of objects through 
                     their relative sizes, duration of an animation, as well as ease-in and ease-out profiles:</p>

            <div class="topic-2-container">
                <h2>Exaggeration</h2>
                <p class="explanation">While trying to keep animations relatable, making them too realistic can result
                     in dry and unappealing motion. Pushing principles of animation a bit beyond the natural limits can 
                     help to bestow them with character and personality:</p>

                <h2>Solid drawing</h2>
                <p class="explanation">Traditionally, this principle refers to properly realizing a scene, such as perspective, 
                    etc. It's about accurately structuring animation code. It's critical that you understand the ins and outs of 
                    the properties that you are using to ensure that your animations are playing back as desired. If you don't
                     build your code with animations in mind, it can be easy for something like this:</p>

                <h2>Appeal</h2>
                <p class="explanation">In a word: charisma. Adding small flourishes to animations can help make them 
                    more dynamic and engaging to users. The life of the party is the life of the party because they attract
                     the attention of the room. It's their appeal and charisma that draws attention to them and keeps it there:</p>
